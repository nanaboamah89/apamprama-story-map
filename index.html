        <h1>Mining Impacts on Apamprama Forest Reserve</h1>
        <h2>A Time-Series Satellite Analysis (2017–2024)</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The Apamprama Forest Reserve, located in Ghana’s Amansie West and Central Districts, is a vital ecological zone within the Moist Semi-Deciduous Forest Belt. This forest provides critical ecosystem services — biodiversity conservation, timber, medicinal plants, and carbon storage. Beneath its canopy lie rich gold deposits, which have driven waves of artisanal and industrial mining in the region.</p>
        <p>This story map uses Digital Earth Africa Sentinel-2 GeoMAD imagery to chronicle the visible impacts of mining from 2017 to 2024. Through satellite evidence, we explore how unregulated extraction is reshaping the forest — threatening its resources, ecological balance, and the communities that depend on it.</p>

        <h3>2017: Intact Forest Landscape</h3>
        <h4>A healthy, undisturbed ecosystem</h4>
        <img src="images/2017.png" alt="2017 image placeholder" />
        <p>Dense, continuous forest canopy dominates the landscape. Minimal visible human disturbance. The forest reserve maintains its ecological integrity, providing habitat, carbon storage, and local livelihoods.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="year-section">
        <h3>2018: First Signs of Encroachment</h3>
        <h4>Early forest edge clearings</h4>
        <img src="images/2018.png" alt="2018 image placeholder" />
        <p>Early signs of land clearing appear at forest edges and near access routes. Small patches of disturbed land may indicate the start of artisanal mining or selective logging activities.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="year-section">
        <h3>2019: Expanding Disturbance</h3>
        <h4>Growing forest fragmentation</h4>
        <img src="images/2019.png" alt="2019 image placeholder" />
        <p>Expansion of cleared patches becomes visible. Fragmentation of forest cover suggests increasing human activity, likely linked to informal mining operations moving deeper into the reserve.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="year-section">
        <h3>2020: Widening Mining Footprint</h3>
        <h4>Permanent canopy loss</h4>
        <img src="images/2020.png" alt="2020 image placeholder" />
        <p>Notable increase in bare ground and disturbed areas. Mining activity is now visibly altering the forest structure, with some areas of the canopy permanently removed. Degraded patches expand along river systems.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="year-section">
        <h3>2021: Fragmented and Vulnerable</h3>
        <h4>Degraded forest and water impacts</h4>
        <img src="images/2021.png" alt="2021 image placeholder" />
        <p>Forest fragmentation intensifies. Larger contiguous areas are now cleared, indicating growing mining pressure. Sediment deposition in nearby rivers and streams becomes more apparent — a sign of mining runoff.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="year-section">
        <h3>2022: Widespread Degradation</h3>
        <h4>Extensive open mining areas</h4>
        <img src="images/2022.png" alt="2022 image placeholder" />
        <p>Extensive bare land emerges across multiple zones of the reserve. The ecological balance is severely disrupted. Evidence of illegal mining operations is consistent with patterns of unchecked exploitation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="year-section">
        <h3>2023: Severe Forest Loss</h3>
        <h4>Escalating ecosystem threat</h4>
        <img src="images/2023.png" alt="2023 image placeholder" />
        <p>Severe forest loss continues. Much of the central and northern parts of the reserve now exhibit open, mined-out areas. Encroachment corridors widen, facilitating further habitat degradation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="year-section">
        <h3>2024: Urgent Need for Intervention</h3>
        <h4>High fragmentation and loss of resilience</h4>
        <img src="images/2024.png" alt="2024 image placeholder" />
        <p>Large portions of the reserve show ongoing and possibly accelerating degradation. Remaining forest is highly fragmented. Urgent interventions are needed to halt further destruction and rehabilitate impacted areas.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Vegetation Loss Trends (2017–2024)</h3>
    <img src="images/Vegetation_Loss_Trends_Apamprama.png" alt="Vegetation Loss Trends Chart" />

    <div class="key-findings">
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <p>1️⃣ Vegetation loss began after 2017, with an initial spike in 2018 (~14% loss), linked to emerging mining activity.</p>
        <p>2️⃣ The most severe year was 2020, when nearly 50% of the forest area showed vegetation loss, with over 26% attributable to possible mining.</p>
        <p>3️⃣ After 2020, mining-related impacts remained substantial (20.8% in 2021), though overall disturbance declined somewhat.</p>
        <p>4️⃣ By 2023–2024, mining impacts continued, with 11.7% of the forest still affected in 2024—showing persistent and ongoing pressures.</p>
        <p>5️⃣ The data confirms that mining is a major driver of forest degradation in this reserve, with cumulative impacts threatening long-term ecological stability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The time-series evidence from 2017 to 2024 reveals a troubling trend: steady and accelerating transformation of Apamprama Forest Reserve due to mining activity. The ecosystem’s resilience is under threat, with profound implications for biodiversity, water systems, carbon storage, and community well-being.</p>
        <p>Timely action is essential: strengthening protected area governance, enforcing mining regulations, supporting community forest stewardship, and integrating satellite-based monitoring into district and national decision-making. The tools are available — now it is a matter of policy and collective will to safeguard what remains of this critical forest landscape.</p>
